## Collaborators / Contributors:

* @frannyaimee Frances Renneboog

## Context: 

Bonus Exercise given by BeCode. This was during the first month of the course. The point of this exercise was to recreate the Star Wars Intro. I did so, with music included and timed correctly. 

## Instructions:
* Create a webpage that reproduces the text crawl at the beginning of the star wars movies. Here are the steps:
* Create a new repo on GitHub called "Star Wars Crawl"
* Create an index.html file, Create a style.css file
* Make use of 'lorem ipsum' to generate fake text (hint)
* Position the content to the center of the page
* Incline the content to perspective (hint: 3D rotation)
* Scroll it to infinity and beyond (astuce: animation, @keyframe, transform, translate3D)
* Personalise the text to tell your adventure at BeCode or, add a cool text / funny story
* Deploy your website online with GitHub Pages

## Bonus Objectives (aka To Become CSS Jedi you find)
* Add a star to the background
* Add the blue text of the introduction "A long time ago.."
* Add a funny picture instead of the Star Wars logo
* Add music thanks to the <audio> tag
